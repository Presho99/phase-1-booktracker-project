# phase-1-booktracker-project
An application that helps members of a certain book club track the 12 books they are to read in 2022.
The booktracker is a one-page application that uses a local API containing the 12 books, each having a variety of properties. The core features of the MVP include a search bar, a menu bar and the main section containing the books. 
The menu bar can be accessed by clicking on the user icon on the header, after which it disappears once the icon is clicked a second time. Inside the menu, there lies a button which enables the user to toggle between dark mode and light mode.
In the main section, each book is displayed. The user can view the covers, titles, authors, and pages pf each book. Hovering over a book displays the synopsis and a "To read" button. Double-clicking a book displays an alert containing words of encouragement for the user.
The application is fully responsive.
